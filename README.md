# PocketGene

Mobile app that enables users to quickly retrieve common info on human genes. Written in Typescript with react-native and managed with Expo.

## Motivation

During my three years of research at UCSD, we were frequently dealing with a mess of genes during literature searches and data analysis. Though tools for gene look up exist online (and are more robust) there were times where it would have been nice to have something quick and easy on my phone.

I also developed this app to further my experience in React, specifically with react-native and mobile development as well as Typescript.

## Using the App

The app is currently in development and will be available on the App store and Google Play store soon. For now, if you want to try it out you can follow the steps below to run the app locally.

### Running with Expo Go
